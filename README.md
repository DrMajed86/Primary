# hello-world
Just started my very first repository on GitHub

I am a micropaleontologist, and for those who are wondering what micropaleontology is? let me explain first:
micropaleontology is a branch of paleontology, and I think most of you knew about paleontotlogy as a science that studys the ancient remains of animals and plants, such as dinosaurs and tree's trunks. 
Similarly to paleontology, micropaleontology is a science focuses on the study of the animal and plant remains in microscopic size usually less than 1 mm in size. 
Believe me once you dive into the world of micropaleontology, you will be astonished of how these tiny microfossils can tell us about ancient Earth. 

Currently, I am conducting my research at McMaster University, School of Geography and Earth Sciences as a full-time PhD candidate. 
My project is using microfossils (mentioned above :) ) to reconstrcut the paleoenviornment condition of an ancient delta namely Ferron-Notom Delta that located in Central Utah, USA. This delta dated back to ~ 90-92 million years, or what we geologists call it the Upper Cretaceous (Turonian)!.
In my work I deal with statistics alot, in particular biostatistics, so I am mainly using "R" since it is free open source software with a great potintial. 
Before "R" I used to program with Microsoft Visual C#, Web application + C# and I did littel of Python. 
I hope that I will be helpfull here at GitHub.
